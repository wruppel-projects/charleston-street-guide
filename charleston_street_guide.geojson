In 1822, Denmark Vesey and members of the Hampstead Church attempted an uprising in Charleston and an escape to Haiti. The uprising was planned for July 14 (Bastille Day). When the day came, there was no storming of Charleston’s streets and buildings. Peter Prioleau, a house slave of Colonel John C. Prioleau, informed his master that he had learned about Vesey’s plot from another slave. Col. Prioleau then raised then alerted the city's intendant (mayor) James Hamilton Jr. Hamilton organized a patrol for the town’s streets and a search for the perpetrators. 131 men were arrested of which 117 were charged with various crimes. 38 were released for lack of evidence. Twenty of the 79 who were tried were acquitted. Eleven of the men acquitted were determined to be so dangerous that they were expelled from the state of South Carolina. Between 6 and 8 a.m. on July 2, 1822, Denmark Vesey and five of his co-conspirators were hanged. By year’s end, another 29 were hanged. The rest, including Vesey’s son, were exiled to Spanish Cuba." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.941272, 32.782334, 0.0 ] } },

In 1866, he went to work for the Charleston Mercury. One year later, Bartholomew Rochelot Riordan and Dawson bought an interest in the Charleston News. In April 1873, Riordan and Dawson were able to acquire the Charleston Courier. They combined the two papers into the News and Courier with Dawson as the editor. Dawson promoted \"fusion\" during Reconstruction. He used the term to encourage white voters to help elect worthy Republicans rather than boycott the polls. In 1888, Pope Leo XIII knighted Dawson to the Order of St. Gregory for his editorials against dueling. Dawson also wrote in fierce opposition to lynching. On March 12, 1889, Dawson entered the office of Dr. Thomas B. McDow. Rather than cure Dawson, McDow shot Dawson twice and killed him after accusing him of making \"dishonorable advances\" towards the governess of his children. McDow was acquitted of murder on the claim of self-defense. The basement today is a dentist's office." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.943173, 32.781018, 0.0 ] } },

The borders of Colleton Square were from 225 East Bay, north to Pinckney Street, west close to Meeting Street, the south close to North Market St. The land remained in Colleton's family until John Colleton sold the land to George Hunter, Thomas Ellery, and Charles Pinckney (1699 - 1758) in 1736. In 1745, Pinckney began the construction of \"The Governor's Mansion\" at the corner of Guignard and East Bay. Pinckney and his wife, Eliza, spent minimal time in the mansion. Most of their time was spent living, working, and raising their children, among whom was Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, on a plantation they owned along the Wappoo Creek. Charles and Eliza Pinckney also lived in London while representing the colony's trade interests from 1753-1758. Meanwhile, Pinckney rented his mansion to royal governors, namely James Glen, William Henry Lyttelton, Thomas Boone, and Charles Greville Montagu. In 1788, the Pinckney family and all those owning an interest in Colleton Square gave Charlestown the land with the condition that it be used for market purposes. Otherwise, the land would revert back to the families." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.927709, 32.781686, 0.0 ] } },

In addition to French and Dutch, Timothy learned to speak fluently German and English. Timothy also learned to be a printer and was hired by Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790). On November 26, 1733, Franklin and Lewis entered into an agreement for Lewis to publish the South Carolina Gazette. After Lewis died in 1738, his wife Elizabeth continued to publish the newspaper under the name of her 13-year-old son, Peter Timothy. The newspaper gained considerable value when it became the official printer for the Assembly, the colony’s governing body. Elizabeth Lewis was also named the postmaster for Charlestowne. In 1745, Elizabeth turned over the newspaper business to her son and opened a bookstore. During the American Revolution, Peter Timothy promoted the Patriot cause in the South Carolina Gazette. As soon as the British were able to occupy Charlestowne, they banished Peter from the city and ended the publication of the South Carolina Gazette. Wherever Peter Lewis decided to go, he died at sea trying to get there. Like Elizabeth Timothy, Peter Timothy's widow, Ann, carried on with Timothy's work by publishing the South Carolina Gazette once the British evacuated Charleston in 1783. From 1786-1802 the newspaper was published in Dr. John Lining’s house at 98 Broad. In 1800, the newspaper was re-named the Charleston Courier. Ann Lewis sold the newspaper in 1802.

Capt. John Bull (d. 1768) bought this lot in 1759. At the time it extended from Church to Meeting. Someone in the Bull family built the house, either John himself, or his widow Mary (d. 1771), or the Bull's granddaughter, Elizabeth Blake. In 1775, England's Royal Governor William Campbell and his wife Sarah Izard moved into the house. Sarah was Elizabeth's cousin. Campbell's stay was short. He avoided potential harm on Sept. 15, 1775, by slipping out of the back of the house, rowing down Vanderhorst Creek, which is present-day Water Street, and boarding His Majesty's Tamar. He remained on the Tamar until Henry Clinton arrived to organize England's attack on Charleston. Campbell was put in command of the gun-deck on the Bristol. He died not long after the Battle of Sullivan's Island from the wounds he incurred. The woodwork inside the Huger House resembles that of the Miles Brewton House, thus likely the work of James Brown. William Elliott Huger bought the house in 1818.

While attending Amherst, Shepherd studied with naturalist Thomas Nuttall (1786-1859). Shepherd served as the chair of chemistry at MUSC from 1834-1861. He returned to MUSC for a few years after the end of the Civil War. In addition to his work at MUSC, Shepherd worked to develop industry in Charleston. He was among the first to promote the local potential for mining phosphate and grew and sold tea. His tea farm was in Summerville. In 1963, Shepard's tea plants were transplanted to a 127-acre potato farm located on Wadmalaw Island. William Barclay Hall purchased the farm in 1987.

St. Philip's burned down in 1835, therefore St. Michael's is the oldest church building in Charleston. The height of the steeple is 186'. The eight bells that ring from the steeple were imported from England in 1764. They have crossed the Atlantic six more times. The British hauled them off when they evacuated Charleston in 1782. A London merchant bought the bells and sent them back to St. Michael's. They were put in safe storage in Columbia during the Civil War only to be burned along with the rest of Columbia in 1865. The metal was salvaged and sent to England to be re-cast. In 1993, the bells were shipped to and from London for repairs. Time in Charleston used to go according to timekeepers ringing the bells of St. Michael's. They chimed the bells every quarter hour. In 1946, an electric clock was installed to ring the bells. The eight bells ring in a pattern called \"changes.\" Changes ring out also at St. Luke and St. Paul and Grace Cathedral giving Charleston the town with the most changes ringing in the country.

Nathaniel Heyward (1766-1851) and Peter and Elizabeth Manigault's daughter, Henrietta, amassed over 20 plantations in South Carolina's Lowcountry. When Joseph Manigault built his house, it would have been considered a suburban home in the present-day neighborhood of Wraggborough. Wraggborough is named after Elizabeth Manigault's father, Joseph Wragg (1698-1751). Joseph Wragg became England's leader in the slave trade after breaking the English crown's monopoly on the business. Joseph Manigault's brother, Gabriel (1758-1809) designed the house. It is one of the most important Adamesque-style houses in the country. The brick is in a Flemish bond. The roof is hipped. There is a layer of lime between the floor and subfloor to prevent decay and to guard against insects. The Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings was organized to rescue the house in 1920. The house was sold at public auction in 1933 and purchased by Princess Henrietta Pignatelli. She then donated the house to the Charleston Museum. At the south end of the house stands a structure that is unique to Charleston. It is a gate temple with a pedimented portico and circular bell roof." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.935452, 32.788962, 0.0 ] } },

It was not until Nov. of 1824 that the museum had a dedicated structure for its collection. The museum was on Chalmers St. and was called the Museum of South Carolina. From 1828 until 1847, the museum was located at the Medical Collge of South Carolina (present-day MUSC). In 1848, the museum was moved to the College of Charleston and became known as the Museum of the College of Charleston. Francis S. Holmes served as the museum's first curator. In 1907, the museum was moved to the Thompson Auditorium on Rutledge Ave. and became known as The Charleston Museum. Laura Bragg was named the museum's director in 1920. She was the first woman in the country to direct a public museum. The museum was moved from the Thompson Auditorium to its current location in 1980. The Thompson Auditorium burned the next year. One of the more dramatic exhibits at The Charleson Museum is a model of the CSS Hunley that can be seen on the northeast corner of Calhoun and Meeting.

In 1823 a Gothic Revival carriage house was built in the rear. In 1995, this property was a virtual wasteland consisting of two derelict buildings and a large garden lost to asphalt paving for a parking lot. After the hard surface had been removed, sixteen truckloads of top soil were spread to provide a planting base. The owner set about designing and executing his garden plan with fencing, walls, and hedges much like a contractor would create the walls of a house.

There is record of a house being built on the property that was likely destroyed during the Revolutionary War. The land continued to change hands until William J. Lowndes became the owner in 1803. Lowndes built the house that stands today short of the front piazza and the Greek Revival arches on the ground floor. They were added by another property owner in 1830. Lowndes named the house and land Lowndes' Grove. From 1811 until his death in 1822, Lowndes represented South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives. By 1901, Lowndes' Grove was owned by Frederick W. Wagener who used the site for a private track for horse racing and for the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition. During the exposition, the house was the Woman's Building by the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Colonial Dames. It is also where President Teddy Roosevelt dined when he traveled to Charleston for the exposition. In 1918, James Sottile purchased Lowndes' Grove. Sottile developed such areas as the Isle of Palms and Lowndes' Grove that enabled him to become among the country's richest men. Out of the 170 acres that was Lowndes' Grove, Sottile left the present-day block that surrounds the house. The house is used today as a venue for special events and has been featured in television programs such as \"Outer Banks.\"" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.966164, 32.801711, 0.0 ] } },
